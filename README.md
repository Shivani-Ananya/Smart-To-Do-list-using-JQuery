# Smart-To-Do-list-using-JQuery
Well, the last project was not comletely mine. I reffered my teacher's project to get the master piece. So i made this project completely from scratch and also to satisfy my current needs.
As a organised person, I would love a soft and aethetic tO-DO list onto my computer.

3. do amrk as done tasks
4. a progress bar to witness your growth
5. and a motivational quote to inspire and make you work towards your goal!!
